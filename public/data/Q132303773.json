Bishop, a funeral director, and Kate L. Thomas Bishop. He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree from Lincoln University in 1912 and went on to Yale Law School. He was a member of the Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was a member of the Yale Law School class of 1915 but left shortly before receiving his degree. He wrote to a Yale staff member in June 1915 that he was \u201cendeavoring to earn sufficient money to return to Yale and complete my studies\u201d and requested a letter of recommendation he could use as he sought employment. At the time of his WWI draft registration, he reported he was a \u201clawyer in Baltimore\u201d and \u201ctaking law examinations in Yale Law School.\u201d He was drafted into the military during WWI and served for one year.  \n\nIn 1918, he married Lucy Cornelia Wilson, also from Baltimore, in New York City. According to a notice in the Baltimore Afro-American (February 20, 1926), it appears they divorced in 1926. He was later married to Ruth J. Bishop and they had a son, Franklin. \n\nHe was an attorney in Baltimore for over 40 years. Early in his career, he partnered with Baltimore attorney and activist J. Steward Davis. Davis was also a law partner of Yale Law School alum Warner T. McGuinn. \n\nW. Norman Bishop died in 1973 and is buried at the Baltimore National Cemetery.  \n",
