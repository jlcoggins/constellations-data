After a one-year internship at the Freedmen\u2019s Hospital in Washington, DC, he settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he practiced medicine from 1901 until his death in 1946.\n\nWright was involved in a number of civic and community organizations. He served as treasurer of Sigma Pi Phi from 1940 to 1946 and as trustee and president of the board of Maryland School for Girls, and was a member of the National and Maryland Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Association. He was president of the National Medical Association from 1908-1909. He was a member of the Grand Jurors Association and active in the national and local YMCA and the national and local Urban League. Wright served as chief umpire of the National Tennis Association and was a member of the Sharon Baptist Church in Baltimore. In 1905, he married Annie Elizabeth Clay. Their daughter Mae was a graduate of Tufts University and New York University. Alumni records suggest Wright was friends with fellow Yale graduates Walter Scott Miller and Warner T. McGuinn, who also lived in Baltimore.\n",
