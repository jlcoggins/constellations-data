She attended classes at the Yale School of Music in the 1909-1910 academic year and from 1911 to 1913. She may have completed the School's program in music theory or its progam in music practice; both were three-year programs. Yale yearbooks list her address as 43 Foote Street. In 1914, she completed a teachers\u2019 program at the Washington Conservatory of Music. According to an obituary in the *New Haven Journal-Courier* (April 16, 1986), she \"directed and organized an all-woman jazz band, where she played for countless dances and fashion shows.\"\n\nShe had a long career as a pianist and music teacher in New Haven. She served as the organist for St. Luke\u2019s Church, Community Baptist Church, and the Keyes-Ammons and Williams Funeral Home, and worked with a number of local choirs. She died in 1986.\n",
