William Augustine Perry was born in 1883 in Tarboro, North Carolina. He attended Hopkins
School in New Haven and, in 1902, completed the collegiate program at Saint Augustine’s in
Raleigh, North Carolina (where Yale graduate Charles H. Boyer served on the faculty). Perry
graduated from Yale College in 1907. While at Yale he contributed to the Yale Courant, a
student publication which ran from 1882 to 1917. In 1911, he married Susan Mabel James in his
hometown of Tarboro, and the couple had four children.

Perry pursued a career in education, working as principal of several schools, including a public
elementary school in Tarboro (1907-1911), St. Athanasius’ School in Brunswick, Georgia (1911-1927), and the Colored Memorial School, also in Brunswick (1927-1928). In 1930 he became a
supervising principal of several schools in Columbia, South Carolina and simultaneously
became director of observation and practice teaching at Allen University in Columbia. He
received a Master’s in Education from Harvard in 1934. He was president of the Richland
County Teachers’ Association from 1932-1934, and starting in 1935 became editor of School
Work, a publication of the Palmetto State Teachers’ Association. He was active in the Columbia
community, participating in the NAACP, Boy Scouts, Masons, and St. Luke’s Protestant
Episcopal Church. Perry died in Columbia in 1939.
