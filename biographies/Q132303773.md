# W. Norman Bishop
## Attended Yale Law School, 1912-1915

William Norman Bishop was born in 1890 in Baltimore, Maryland to John A. Bishop, a funeral director, and Kate L. Thomas Bishop. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Lincoln University in 1912 and went on to Yale Law School. He was a member of the Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was a member of the Yale Law School class of 1915 but left shortly before receiving his degree. He wrote to a Yale staff member in June 1915 that he was “endeavoring to earn sufficient money to return to Yale and complete my studies” and requested a letter of recommendation he could use as he sought employment. At the time of his WWI draft registration, he reported he was a “lawyer in Baltimore” and “taking law examinations in Yale Law School.” He was drafted into the military during WWI and served for one year.  

In 1918, he married Lucy Cornelia Wilson, also from Baltimore, in New York City. According to a notice in the Baltimore Afro-American (February 20, 1926), it appears they divorced in 1926. He was later married to Ruth J. Bishop and they had a son, Franklin. 

He was an attorney in Baltimore for over 40 years. Early in his career, he partnered with Baltimore attorney and activist J. Steward Davis. Davis was also a law partner of Yale Law School alum Warner T. McGuinn. 

W. Norman Bishop died in 1973 and is buried at the Baltimore National Cemetery.
