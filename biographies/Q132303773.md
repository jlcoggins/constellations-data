# W. Norman Bishop
## Attended Yale Law School, 1912-1915

William Norman Bishop was born in 1890 in Baltimore, Maryland, to John A. Bishop, a shoemaker, and Kate L. Thomas Bishop.[^1] He graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Lincoln University in 1912 and went on to Yale Law School.[^2] He attended Yale until 1915 and was a member of the Zeta Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1916, Bishop passed the state bar examination in Maryland.[^3] At the time of his 1917 draft registration, he reported he was a “lawyer in Baltimore” and “taking law examinations in Yale Law School.” He was drafted into the military during WWI and served for one year.  

In 1921, Bishop married Cornelia L. Wilson, a teacher at the Colored High School in Baltimore, in New York City.[^4] According to a notice in the *Baltimore Afro-American* (February 20, 1926), it appears they divorced in 1926.[^5] Bishop continued to practice law in Baltimore for decades where he was also elected to the bar association.[^6] In 1920, his law firm represented *The Observer* in a libel suit where the plaintiff was represented by W. Ashbie Hawkins and George W. F. McMechen, the latter graduating from Yale Law School in 1895.[^7] In that same year, Bishop and other Republican African-Americans nominated W. Ashbie Hawkins to run for Senate.[^8]  

Bishop remained an active member within the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. In May 1919, according to Delta Lambda’s history, William Norman Bishop was one of the founding members of the graduate chapter of Delta Lambda in Baltimore, Maryland.[^9] According to a 1921 article in *The Sphinx*, he was a secretariat member relaying information to Alpha Phi Alpha on the actions of the chapter.[^10] In 1932, he was elected as vice president of the Delta Lambda Chapter.[^11] 

According to the 1940 U.S. Census, Bishop was married to Ruth J. and had a son, William Franklin, who was 10 years old.[^12] According to *The Sun*, William Franklin died in 1941 at the age of 11.[^13] At the time of his 1942 draft registration, Bishop reported that he was self-employed. Bishop died in 1973 and is buried at the Baltimore National Cemetery.
