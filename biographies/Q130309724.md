# Francis A. Thomas
## Graduate of Yale Divinity School, 1939
Born in 1913 in Wilberforce, Ohio, Francis A. Thomas became a respected philosopher, scholar, and higher education administrator. He was a grandson of Wilberforce University President Benjamin F. Lee, and his family had deep ties to the AME church. Thomas received a BA from Wesleyan College (now University) and a BD from Yale. He went on to earn a doctorate from Indiana University and an MA from Miami University. Early in his career, Thomas taught at Payne Theological Seminary (associated with Wilberforce University). From 1948 to 1978, he was a faculty member at Central State University, where he chaired the philosophy department, among other roles. From 1979 to 1997, he served as dean of Payne Theological Seminary. In 1981, Thomas was appointed professor emeritus of philosophy at Central State. In a 2003 tribute, former students and colleagues praised Thomas' legacy as an influential teacher and mentor. Thomas also advocated for greater Black representation in the philosophy profession at American Philosophical Association meetings. Thomas died in 2001.
