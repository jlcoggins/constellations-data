## Attended Yale Graduate School, circa 1937
Donald Mtimkulu was born circa 1908 in South Africa. His father was a Methodist minister. He studied race relations in the Yale Graduate School in the 1930s and also attended the London School of Economics. He had a long career in higher education, serving as head of Adams College, then taking a professorship in education at the University of Fort Hare in the 1950s. In 1959, when the Extension of University Education Act fully segregated higher education in South Africa by race and barred Black students from attending white universities, Mtimkulu left the university. He lived in Zambia for a time, then in Ontario, where he taught at the University of Waterloo. He was married to Clytie Mtimkulu and the couple had three children. He died in 2000.
