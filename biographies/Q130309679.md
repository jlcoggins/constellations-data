# James William Morris
## Graduate of Yale Divinity School, 1874
Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1847, James William Morris graduated from Lincoln University in 1871. He enrolled a year after Solomon Melvin Coles, but because of credits he had already earned, he graduated a year before Coles, making him the first Black graduate of the Divinity School. After graduating from Yale, he preached in Beaufort and Aiken, South Carolina. Morris died of tuberculosis in Aiken in 1876 at the age of 28.
