# James Warren Payton
## Graduate of Yale College, 1900
Born in Westfield, Massachusetts in 1877, Payton was the son of Philip A. Payton and Annie M. Ryans Payton. In high school, he completed the classical course, studying Latin and Greek, and was the class orator at his commencement. After graduating from Yale, Payton worked as a tutor in his hometown before becoming a professor of Greek and Latin at Wiley University, a Black institution in Texas. On a trip home he contracted typhoid fever and died, in 1902, after a short illness. His brother Edward graduated from Yale in 1906. 

In 1900, while still at Yale, Payton wrote an essay for the magazine The Colored American, entitled, “Some Experiences and Customs at Yale.” He finished the essay, the most detailed, known account of Yale life by an early African American student, with this reflection:
