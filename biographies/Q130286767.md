# Henry Williams Foster
## Graduate of Yale School of Medicine, 1861
Henry Williams Foster graduated from the School of Medicine in 1861. Born in Liberia, he lived for a time with fellow medical student William Henry Ealbeck, also from Liberia, at 63 Goffe St. He also lived, in 1860, with a Black family originally from North Carolina. In 1861, Foster wrote a “Dissertation on Intermittent Fever of West Africa.” He was listed as a physician in New Haven in the 1870 federal census. Available census records suggest Foster may have been born in 1831 and died in 1875; a Henry Williams Foster of his approximate age is buried in Evergreen Cemetery.
