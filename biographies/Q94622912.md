# Nimrod Booker Allen
## Graduate of Yale Divinity School, 1915
A native of Girard, Alabama, Nimrod Booker Allen received his undergraduate degree from
Wilberforce University in Ohio before attending the Yale Divinity School and graduating with a
bachelor’s of divinity in 1915. At Yale, he was a member of Zeta Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity. Allen lived much of his life in Columbus, Ohio, where he was active in social services,
serving as the Columbus Urban League’s executive secretary for nearly 40 years. The
organization provided support for Black residents of Columbus—particularly recent migrants
from the South—throughout the Great Migration and into the early Civil Rights era. Allen
founded two other social services organizations: Frontiers of America (now known as Frontiers
International, Inc., founded 1936), and the Ohio Conference of Social Work Among Negroes. He
was also a member of the NAACP. In addition to his social service work, Allen was locally
involved as a high layman in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, as well as being an
executive secretary in the local YMCA.

Nimrod Booker Allen died in Columbus in 1977 at the age of 91.

His brother, Alexander Joseph Allen, attended Yale Divinity School in the same period. A
nephew, Alexander Joseph Allen, Jr., graduated in 1940.
