# William Simon
## Attended Yale Divinity School 1915-1916
Little is currently known about William Simon. Born in New Iberia, Louisiana in 1888, he received his BS from Howard University in 1915. He then attended Yale Divinity School from 1915 to 1916, but did not receive a degree. In a 1922 Divinity School publication, his residence was listed as Louisiana. In the 1948 Yale alumni directory, his address was provided only as “Care of Mitchell Simon” in his hometown of New Iberia.
