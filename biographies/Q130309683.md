Balamu Jaberi Mukasa was born in 1904 in Hoima, Uganda, the son of a Gombolo chief. Mukasa served as the secretary to the chief of his tribe. In 1928, Mukasa had a chance meeting with John Hope, then serving as president of Morehouse College, while both were in Jerusalem.  Hope encouraged Mukasa to come to the United States, where he spent eight years. During that time, he attended the Atlanta University Laboratory High School and graduated from Morehouse College, where he was the winner of a prize for excellence in accounting. After Morehouse, Mukasa attended Yale University, where he graduated with a master’s degree in international relations in 1937. Following graduation, Mukasa planned to return home and become a teacher.  He sailed to Uganda aboard the Acquitania. Subsequently, Mukasa served as prime minister under King Tito Gafabusa Winyi, C.B.E., called the “Omukama.” Prime Minister Mukasa served under the hereditary ruler of Bunyaro, a 5,000 square mile territory, with a tax-paying population of 20,000. Later, Bulamu Mukasa worked as a radio commentator and information advisor for the then British Protectorate of Uganda.
