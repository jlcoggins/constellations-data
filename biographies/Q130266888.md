# Raymond Alexander Augustus Claymes
## Graduate of Yale Divinity School, 1920
Born in 1892 in Brenham, Texas, Raymond Alexander Augustus Claymes studied at Wiley University (Texas) and Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) before graduating from Howard University in 1916. He studied religion at Yale from 1916 to 1920.

In 1928, Claymes worked as an undercover investigator for the Committee of Fourteen, tasked with researching and undercovering prostitution in Harlem hotels and nightclubs. Claymesâ€™ findings were the basis for increased police surveillance, raids of numerous nightspots, and greater attention on issues of prostitution and vice in Harlem. Also in 1928, he began performing as a baritone in New York churches and concert halls. The New York Age reported that he sang in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. He worked in New York public schools, teaching Spanish during the day and English as a second language to immigrants in evening classes. 

In 1935, he married the pianist Arnetta Jones, a graduate of Julliard. Jones continued to perform under her maiden name and gained renown, especially as a music teacher, in New York City. Raymond Claymes died in 1966 and is buried in Litchfield, Connecticut.
